Welcome to my personal site!

I'm a fourth year undergraduate student from [Department of Electronic Engineering](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), major in electronic science and technology. I am also pursuing a minor degree in statistics. My research interest spreads broadly in computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, multimedia system and media philosophy. 

I have close contact with [Prof. OOI Wei Tsang](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/ooiwt/) from [Scool of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/).

(Still under construction... Please keep waiting...)

I firmly believe that from the perspective of media philosophy, the optimization of media can promote the development of social productivity and even change the production mode, which will have a huge impact on the future.
