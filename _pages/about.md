Hi, Welcome to my personal site!

I'm a last-year undergraduate from [Department of Electronic Engineering](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) and [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), major in electronic science and technology, with a minor degree in statistics. My research interest spreads broadly in computer vision, machine learning, neuromorphic computing and multimedia system. 

I have close contact with [Prof. Zhichao Lu](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~zhichalu/) from [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/), [CityU](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) and [Prof. OOI Wei Tsang](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/ooiwt/) from [Scool of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/).

(Still under construction... Please keep waiting...)
