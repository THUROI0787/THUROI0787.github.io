Hi, Welcome to my personal site!

I'm a last-year undergraduate from [Department of Electronic Engineering](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) and [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), major in Electronic Science and Technology, with a minor degree in Statistics. My research interest spreads broadly in machine learning, neuromorphic computing, computer vision and multimedia system. 

I have close contact with [Prof. Zhichao Lu](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~zhichalu/) from [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/), [CityU](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) and [Prof. OOI Wei Tsang](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/ooiwt/) from [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/).

======
I am studying for a minor degree in statistics at Tsinghua this semester, trying to survive five difficult courses. 

And I'm doing some interesting research right now.

Research Vision
======
My research interest spreads broadly in artificial intelligence, including theory and applications. 

As for applications, I firmly believe that from the perspective of media philosophy, the optimization of media can catalyze advancements in social productivity and revolutionize production paradigms, which will have a huge impact on the future. Thus I'm keen in leveraging AI for enhancing interactive multimedia applications, especially through the lens of computer vision problems.

As for theory, my research interests lie at the intersection of dynamical systems, cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence. I'm committed to constructing powerful models and algorithms, drawing inspiration from the intrinsic principles and mechanisms observed within the human brain. The long-term goal of my research is to augment human intelligence with more capable, efficient and sustainable AI.
