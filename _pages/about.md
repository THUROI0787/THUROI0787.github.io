Hi, I'm Roi. Welcome to my personal site!

I'm a last-year undergraduate from [Department of Electronic Engineering](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) and [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), major in Electronic Science and Technology, with a minor degree in Statistics. My research interest spreads broadly in machine learning, neuromorphic computing, computer vision and multimedia system. 

I have close contact with [Prof. Zhichao Lu](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~zhichalu/) from [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/), [CityU](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) and [Prof. OOI Wei Tsang](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/ooiwt/) from [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/).

Research Vision
======
My research interests span broadly across artificial intelligence, encompassing both theory and applications.

As for applications, I firmly believe that through the lens of media philosophy, optimizing media can act as a catalyst for advancements in social productivity, transforming production paradigms and significantly influencing the future. Therefore, I am particularly interested in harnessing AI to enhance interactive multimedia applications, with a special focus on tackling computer vision challenges.

As for theory, my research interests lie at the intersection of dynamical systems, cognitive neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. I am dedicated to developing powerful models and algorithms inspired by the intrinsic principles and mechanisms observed in the human brain. Ultimately, my research aims to empower human intelligence with more capable, efficient, and sustainable AI.
